# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Async Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: failing to properly handle promise rejections in asynchronous routes.  Without proper error handling, these failures can go unnoticed, leading to silent failures or inconsistent application behavior.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that performs an asynchronous operation using promises.  However, it lacks proper error handling for the `catch` block of the promise, resulting in potential unhandled promise rejections. This could lead to the app crashing, or the user receiving an incomplete or missing response.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to fix this issue by implementing appropriate error handling within the asynchronous route's `catch` block. This ensures graceful handling of errors, preventing application crashes and providing informative responses to the client.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `node bug.js` to run the buggy application. Observe the lack of explicit response for failures.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to observe the improved error handling and response.
